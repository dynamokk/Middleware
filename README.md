# Middleware
Middleware of Redux

Middleware is some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response.
It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.
People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

Example:
git clone https://github.com/dynamokk/Middleware.git;
cd AppMiddleware;
npm install;
npm start;
